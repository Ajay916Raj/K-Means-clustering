# K-Means-clustering
Created a simple K-Means clustering model, grouping countries based on their geographical center. And another model using the language spoken. Finally using the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.

# Pros and Cons of K-Means clustering
> Picking the right K, the same can be solved by using the elbow method but its really not that scientific.
> Initialization of seeds or the center of cluster should be chosen with context.
> Highly sensitive to outliers. As observed above Australia geographically will always be a cluster in its own. Solution could be done by removing outliers. But here its not an option.
